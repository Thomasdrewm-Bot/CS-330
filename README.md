How do I approach designing software?

  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  It has helped me recognize certain situations where it's better to actually modularize the code, pull it out of the other aspects of the code and make it into a unique
  object of it's own in order to better utilize the same code over again.
  
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
  First I would design something to see how it implements in the code, using the other designed code and working with it to shape the part of the project I was currently working on,
  then I would pull that piece of code out, once I got it working, in order to sequester it into it's own class to make the code cleaner and more simple to read and work with.
  
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  One tactic I need to utitlize more, and will utilize more in the future is separating different parts of the code into seperate files. I did not do as much for this one but,
  it can help in the long term with code readability to be able to extract these different portions of code out in order to increase modularity as well as clean up the main source
  code of the program. Encapsulating these different tasks that are going to be used and reused into a separate file of their own so that all I need to do is call them.
  
How do I approach developing programs?

  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  Worked on developing code with classes that I don't entirely understand myself and how to navigate around those, as well as how to better understand the inclusion of libraries into my IDE
  and the ability to load these resources into my system. Not all the time will you have an obvious and complete breakdown of what a class will do, that's hte point of encapsulation, it's more important
  to understand how to utilize these tools offered to me.
  
  How did iteration factor into your development?
  Iteration factored into my development in the process of refining and developing the different meshes for the 3d objects. Going over them one step at a time by creating the objects first, getting them
  into the correct positions and then moving forward with the next set of details such as the texture, and then the lighting in the scene. Going step by step and working through the problems presented to me
  in order to develop the final project.
  
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  I started out just kind of hard coding everything into the main render class, but as time went on, I noticed it became harder to work in the space. It taught me more of the importance of separating out code
  and moving it to it's own resource area to be better utilized as a function. Not only is it easier to work with, but it makes a big difference in your 'work area.' Being able to condense something as large as 
  creating a mesh for an object, shifting it's location, scale, textures, etcetera from a brick of code to a simple line in the ultimate rendering class can make a huge adjustment on not just readability but in work sapce.
  It also helps to utlizie some of the tools of the IDE, such as being able to collapse entire blocks of code to make navigatring the coding document easier.
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  It taught me a lot about how the machine interprets our code and also how to move things from the main CSU to the GPU in order to have it offloaded and processed by the other portion of our computer. It taught me a lot
  in the way of just how certain things work and how they're utilized in order to get the output we want. It helps to be able to better understand how these graphics are made and in what way we can make them function
  for the tasks and uses we need of them.
  
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  It can potentially help me in my new future pathway in regards to working with various apps and programs that may require me in the future to work with graphics. It's hard to say what route I will take now, but it's       possible I end up working in a design space that would require at least a basic knowledge of these subjects. Even if I'm not personally interested in it, knowing about something or how something works can only help to 
  further your understanding on other subjects in the long run.
